# System Prompt — Reference Material Protocol
<!-- ============================================================
     SYSTEM PROMPT — EDIT ONLY WITH CLAUDE'S HELP
     
     This file governs how Claude handles reference material
     during new project setup and throughout the project lifecycle.
     
     To update these rules, tell Claude:
     "Update the references protocol to [your change]."
     ============================================================ -->

## Purpose

Reference images and URLs shape every design decision — materials, atmosphere,
lighting, and style. This protocol ensures references are collected during setup,
stored consistently in the project folder, and actively used during the build.

---

## When to Run This Protocol

- During new project setup (Phase 0), after the project directory is created
- Any time during the project when the user says:
    "Add this reference: [url or file path]"
    "I found an image I want to add"
    "Here's some inspiration for the [element]"

---

## Phase 0 — Reference Collection

### Step 1 — Ask about existing reference folders

After the project directory is created, ask:

  "Do you want to use any of the existing reference folders from the
   master library? I'll show you what's available."

Scan the master references directory:
  C:\Users\swags\Documents\aec_demo_master\architectural_references\

List the subfolders found. For each one, state its name and (if possible)
the number of files inside it.

Example output:
  "Here's what's in the master library:
   • modernist          (24 images)
   • mood_boards        (18 images)
   • patio              (12 images)
   • landscape          (9 images)
   • furniture          (15 images)
   
   Which of these are relevant to this project?
   You can name them one at a time, say 'all of them', or say 'none'."

Write confirmed folder paths to Section 13 of project_prompt.md under
"Existing reference folders". Do NOT copy files — just reference the paths.

### Step 2 — Ask about new files

Ask:
  "Do you have any new reference images on your computer that you'd
   like to add to this project? If so, tell me the file path or
   drag the file into the chat and I'll copy it to your project folder."

If the user provides a file path:
  - Copy the file to: aa_demo_versions/[project]/references/
  - Add the filename to Section 13 under "Project references"
  - Ask: "What does this reference show? What aspect of the design
          does it inform?" (one sentence is enough)
  - Write filename + description to the project prompt

If the user provides a file via the chat interface:
  - Save it to: aa_demo_versions/[project]/references/[original_filename]
  - Ask the same description question
  - Write to project prompt

Create the references/ folder if it doesn't exist.

### Step 3 — Ask about URLs

Ask:
  "Any websites, Pinterest boards, Archdaily pages, or other URLs
   you want to save as references? Paste them one at a time."

For each URL provided:
  - Attempt to fetch and save a copy of the page or image:
      - If it's a direct image URL (.jpg, .png, .webp, etc.):
          Download the image to references/ with a descriptive filename
      - If it's a web page (Archdaily, Pinterest, Houzz, etc.):
          Save the URL to a file: references/url_references.txt
          Add a line: [url]  |  [user description]
  - Ask: "What does this reference? What aspect of the design does it show?"
  - Write URL + description to Section 13 under "URL references"

### Step 4 — Review and summarise

After all references are collected, review them:

  - Read or scan any files that can be opened (images, PDFs)
  - Look at URLs that were successfully fetched
  - Write a 3-5 sentence summary of the overall visual direction:
      What mood, palette, materials, and character do the references
      collectively suggest? This becomes the "Reference summary" in
      Section 13 and actively guides Claude's decisions in later phases.

Say to the user:
  "I've reviewed your references. Here's what I take from them:
   [summary]
   
   Does that match what you're going for?"

If the user corrects or adds nuance, update the summary.

---

## During the Project — Adding References Later

The user can add references at any time by saying:
  "Add this reference: [file path or URL]"
  "I found an image for the [element]"
  "Here's what I want the [material/space/feature] to look like: [url]"

Run the appropriate step from above (Step 2 or Step 3).
Update Section 13 of project_prompt.md immediately.
If the reference changes a design decision already made, flag it:
  "This reference suggests [X] — your current project prompt says [Y].
   Do you want to update it?"

---

## How References Are Used in Phase Execution

Every phase prompt that involves visual decisions (materials, lighting,
camera framing, entourage) should:

1. Check Section 13 of project_prompt.md for relevant references
2. If references exist for this element, prioritise them over system defaults
3. When making a subjective decision (e.g. choosing an HDR, a color value,
   a camera angle), cite the reference that informed the choice:
   "Using warm golden-hour HDR — matches the sunset mood in [reference_filename]"

References are not suggestions — they are constraints. If a reference shows
a specific material, Claude should match it, not approximate it.

## File and Folder Conventions

  Project references folder:
    aa_demo_versions/[project]/references/

  Subfolder structure (created as needed):
    references/images/     ← copied image files
    references/downloads/  ← images downloaded from URLs
    references/url_references.txt  ← saved URLs with descriptions

  Naming convention for downloaded files:
    [element]_ref_[NNN].[ext]
    e.g.  entry_ref_001.jpg   patio_ref_001.png   wall_material_ref_001.jpg

  Master library location (read-only, never modified):
    C:\Users\swags\Documents\aec_demo_master\architectural_references\
